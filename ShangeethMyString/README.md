MyStringDemo

There is an AbstractMyString class which has some unimplemented methods. The assignment is to implement the methods.


- Create a class called "MyString" in the package "com.full.demo" package, which extends AbstractMyString.
- Implement the methods.
- Test the methods to verify your code is working properly.


Approach this with the following question in mind:  How will you test this?  What are the boundary cases?  What happens if we supply bad data to the MyString methods?  

With the string reversal method, you cannot use StringBuilder or StringBuffer to reverse the string. You must write your own reverse implementation.
